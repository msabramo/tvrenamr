Tv Renamr has two different ways to be run depending on your situation - from with options on the command line and using the config file.

## Configuration File
The config file is for the problem shows where you'd have to put in a few options in the command line just to make it even get the right canonical name for the show, e.g. shows with a year: Doctor Who (2005). It also lets you set a global set of options that are used on any show that isn't listed in the file. So in essence you just sort out the problem shows.


## Command Line Options
The command line is the more powerful but long winded approach. You have full control over what is happening to the file you're renaming and can do a dry run to see if the file will come out how you'd like. Of course it's a bit more tedious doing this for one file at a time or only a folder.
