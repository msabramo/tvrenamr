Tv Renamr relies on having a .tvrenamr folder in your home directory so first create one of those. This is for the configuration file and where your logs will live.

Now choose an installation method from below:

# PyPi 

[PyPi](http://pypi.python.org) is the Python Package index and providing you have the Python [setup tools](http://) installed you can install Tv Renamr from there by running: `easy_install tvrenamr`.


# Github

Tv Renamr's source code is hosted on [Github](http://github.com/ghickman/tvrenamr) (much like this site!) where you can git clone or download it.

Once you have the files run `python setup.py install` to install it to your site-packages folder.



# That's It!

If all went well (nothing exploding is usually a good indication of this) Tv Renamr should now be installed to your system.

You can then run it with the command `tvr <FILE>/<DIR>`.
